#MDK
MDK (soon to be renamed to Origo) is the web mapping framework created and used in the project Mälardalskartan. The framework uses the mapping library [OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org/) . The project Mälardalskartan is a collaboration between four municipalities in Sweden including Enköping, Eskilstuna, Strängnäs and Västerås.


##Usage

Documentation on how to build and use MDK with Browserify is coming soon.
